<!-- We currently use <a href="http://www.artifact-eval.org/guidelines.html">the following guidelines</a> 
for packaging artifact submissions. However, we are preparing a revised version that should be available
around mid-October 2015! 
-->
 
<p>
This guide should help you describe, pack 
and submit your artifacts for a review.


It gradually evolves based on <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$prior_ae$#ck_page_suffix#$">our past Artifact Evaluations</a>
and your feedback (see this <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/GrigoriFursin/presentation-fursin-aecgoppopp2015">presentation</a>
with an outcome of the past PPoPP/CGO'15 AE).


It should also help you prepare your artifacts 
for a possible public release, if you plan to do so
(for example as an auxiliary material in a Digital
Library or on your personal web page).


<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2>What to expect</h2>

You will need to prepare a small and relatively informal guide for reviewers 
using our <a href="$#ck_url_template_pull#$templates/ae_template_20151015.tex">AE LaTeX template</a> 
to explain what are your artifacts, how to access and 
use them, and what is the expected result.

At least two reviewers will follow your guide to replicate 
your results (for example, exact output match) or reproduce them 
(for example, slightly varying performance numbers or scalability
on a different machine), and will then send you a report with the 
following overall assessment of your artifact based 
on our <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$reviewing$#ck_page_suffix#$">reviewing guidelines</a>:

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>significantly exceeded expectations</b>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>exceeded expectations</b>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>met expectations</b>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>fell below expectations</b>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>significantly fell below expectations</b>
 </li>
</ul>

where <b>"met expectations" score or above</b> means that your artifact 
successfully passed evaluation and will receive a stamp of approval. 

The highest ranked artifact will also receive a <i>"distinguished artifact" 
award</i>  (see <a href="http://cTuning.org/event/ae-ppopp2015">PPoPP'15</a> 
and <a href="http://cTuning.org/event/ae-cgo2015">CGO'15</a> AE prizes)
announced at the joint CGO-PPoPP'16 AE discussion session.

Anyone is welcome to provide a feedback about how to improve AE
during this session.

<p>
Since our eventual goal is not to name and shame
problematic artifacts, but to promote artifact
validation and sharing, you will be able to address
raised issues during the rebuttal.

Furthermore, we allow light communication between reviewers and authors 
whenever there are installation/usage problems.

In such cases, AE chairs will serve as a proxy to avoid 
revealing reviewers' identity (unless you submit artifacts 
along with your publication for an <a href="http://adapt-workshop.org">ADAPT 
workshop with a public Reddit-based discussion</a>).

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2>Preparing artifacts for submission</h2>

To minimize your effort, we prepared a <a href="$#ck_url_template_pull#$templates/ae_template.tex">LaTeX template</a> 
which you can fill in, append to the end of your paper, and submit the final PDF for the artifact review.

Each template subsection is described below.

If you encounter problems or have any questions, do not hesitate to 
contact <a href="mailto:childers@cs.pitt.edu;Grigori.Fursin@cTuning.org">AE chairs</a> privately
or use our public <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/grp/home?gid=7433414">LinkedIn group</a> 
and this <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/collective-knowledge">mailing list</a>.

<h2>Artifact sharing</h2>

Though you are not obliged to publicly release your artifacts 
(in fact, it is sometimes impossible due to various limitations), 
we strongly encourage you to share them with the community
(even if they are not open-source).

You can release them as an auxilary material in Digital Libraries,
your institutional repository, various open services for code
and data sharing.

<p>

Based on the outcome of the past AE and your feedback, 
we are now working on an open-source technology that 
can improve artifact sharing, validation and reuse:
<ul>
 <li>
  <b><a href="http://www.occamportal.org">OCCAM portal</a></b> - enabling open curation for computer architecture modeling.
 </li>
 <li>
  <b><a href="http://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki">Collective Knowledge Framework (CK)</a></b> - 
  converting artifacts into reusable components with python wrapper and unified JSON API
  shared via <a href="http://github.com/ctuning/ck">GitHub</a> (see example of PLDI'15
  CLSmith artifact converted into CK) and enabling interactive and reproducible articles
  (see example of a <a href="http://cknowledge.org/repo/web.php?wcid=report:b0779e2a64c22907">universal 
  OpenCL autotuning report</a> or this website ). 
 </li>
</ul>
