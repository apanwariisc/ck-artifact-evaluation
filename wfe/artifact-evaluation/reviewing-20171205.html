This document (<b>V20171205</b>) provides guidelines to review artifacts.

It gradually evolves to define common evaluation criteria based 
on <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$prior_ae$#ck_page_suffix#$">our past Artifact Evaluations</a>,
<a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging">ACM reviewing and badging policy</a> 
which we co-authored in 2016, and your feedback (<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/GrigoriFursin/enabling-open-and-reproducible-computer-systems-research-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly">2017a</a>,

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2>Reviewing process</h2>

After an artifact submission deadline specific to a given
event, AE reviewers will bid on artifacts they would
like to review based on an artifact abstract and
check-list, their competencies, and access to specific
hardware and software, while avoiding conflicts of interest
(if any).

Within a few days, AE chairs will 
make a final reviewer selection to ensure at least 
three or more reviewers per artifact.

<p>
Reviewers will then have approximately two weeks to evaluate artifacts 
and provide a report via dedicated submission website (usually EasyChair or HotCRP).

Reviewers will be also allowed to communicate with authors about encountered issues immediatelly
and anonymously via submission website in order to quickly resolve issues
(our point is not to fail problematic artifacts but to help authors improve
publicily available ones and pass evaluation).

<p>
During rebuttal phase (a technical clarification phase), 
authors will be able to respond to the final evaluation.

Finally AE chairs will decide which set of badges 
to award (see below) based on all reviews and authors responses.

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2>Artifact evaluation</h2>

  Reviewers will need to read a paper and then thoroughly go through authors' appendix 
  step-by-step to evaluate a given artifact and then describe their experience at each stage 
  (success or failure, encountered problems and how they were possibly solved, 
  and questions or suggestions to the authors), and then give a score 
  on scale -1 .. +1 where

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>+1)</b> exceeded expectations<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>0)</b> met expectations (or inapplicable)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>-1)</b> fell below expectations<br>

The author-created artifacts relevant to this paper

<i>only if</i> they have been placed on
a publically accessible archival repository. A DOI or link to this repository
along with a unique identifier for the object is provided.

<p>
<b>Notes:</b>

ACM does not mandate the use of specific repositories. Publisher repositories
(such as the ACM Digital Library), institutional repositories, or open
commercial repositories (e.g., figshare or Dryad) are acceptable. In all cases,
repositories used to archive data should have a declared plan to enable
permanent accessibility. Personal web pages are not acceptable for this
purpose.

<p>
Artifacts do not need to have been formally evaluated in order for an article
to receive this badge. In addition, they need not be complete in the sense
described above. They simply need to be relevant to the study and add value
beyond the text in the article. Such artifacts could be something as simple
as the data from which the figures are drawn, or as complex as a complete
software system under study.

<p>
<i>We collaborate with <a href="http://acm.org">ACM</a> 
to unify packing and sharing of artifacts as reusable and customizable components
using <a href="http://cKnowledge.org">Collective Knowledge framework</a>
(see <a href="https://dl.acm.org/docs/reproducibility.cfm">ACM announcement</a>).
Note that authors are not obliged to use CK and can use any other suitable workflow framework
to receive this badge. Check out reusable and customizable workflow from CGO'17 
which was shared using CK framework:

The artifacts associated with the paper will receive an "Artifact Evaluated - Reusable" badge 
<i>only if</i> they are of a quality that significantly exceeds minimal functionality. 
That is, they have all the qualities of the Artifacts Evaluated - Functional level, 
but, in addition, they are very carefully documented and well-structured to the extent 
that reuse and repurposing is facilitated. In particular, norms and standards of the research
community for artifacts of this type are strictly adhered to.
