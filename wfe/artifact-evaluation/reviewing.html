This document (<b>V20151015</b>) provides guidelines to review artifacts.

It gradually evolves to define common evaluation criteria based 
on <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$prior_ae$#ck_page_suffix#$">our past Artifact Evaluations</a>
and your feedback (see this <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/GrigoriFursin/presentation-fursin-aecgoppopp2015">presentation</a>
with an outcome of the past PPoPP/CGO'15 AE).
