This document (<b>V20190108</b>) provides guidelines to review artifacts.

It gradually evolves to define common evaluation criteria based 
on <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$prior_ae$#ck_page_suffix#$">our past Artifact Evaluations and open discussions</a>,
the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging">ACM reviewing and badging policy</a> 
(which we contributed to as a part of the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/task-force-on-data-software-and-reproducibility">ACM taskforce on reproducibility</a>), 
<a href="http://artifact-eval.org">artifact-eval.org</a> and your feedback (<a href="https://portalparts.acm.org/3230000/3229762/fm/frontmatter.pdf">2018a</a>,

<h2>Reviewing process</h2>

After an artifact submission deadline specific to a given
event, AE reviewers will bid on artifacts they would
like to review based on a provided artifact abstract and
check-list, their competencies, and access to specific
hardware and software, while avoiding possible 
conflicts of interest.

Within a few days, AE chairs will make the final reviewer selection 
to ensure at least three or more reviewers per artifact.

<p>
Reviewers will then have approximately 2..3 weeks to evaluate artifacts 
and provide a report using a dedicated artifact submission website (usually HotCRP).

Reviewers will be communicating with authors about encountered issues 
continuously and anonymously via submission website in order to quickly resolve issues
- our philosophy of artifact evaluation is not to fail problematic artifacts 
but to help authors improve at least publicly available ones and pass evaluation!

<p>
In the end, AE chairs will then decide on a set of badges (see below)
to award to a given artifact based on all reviews and authors responses.

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2>Artifact evaluation</h2>

  Reviewers will need to read a paper and then thoroughly go through authors' artifact appendix 
  step-by-step to evaluate a given artifact. They should then describe their experience at each stage 
  (success or failure, encountered problems and how they were possibly solved, 
  and questions or suggestions to the authors), and then give a score 
  on scale -1 .. +1 where

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>+1)</b> exceeded expectations<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>0)</b> met expectations (or inapplicable)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>-1)</b> fell below expectations<br>

The author-created artifacts relevant to this paper 
will receive an ACM "artifact available" badge 
<b>only if</b> they have been placed on
a publicly accessible archival repository
such as <a href="https://zenodo.org">Zenodo</a>, 
<a href="https://figshare.com">FigShare</a>,
and <a href="http://datadryad.org">Dryad</a>.
A DOI will be then assigned to their artifacts
and must be provided in the Artifact Appendix!

<b>Notes:</b>

ACM does not mandate the use of above repositories. However, publisher repositories,
institutional repositories, or open commercial repositories are acceptable
<b>only</b> if they have a declared plan to enable permanent accessibility!
<b>Personal web pages, GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket are not acceptable for this purpose.</b>

<p>
Artifacts do not need to have been formally evaluated in order for an article
to receive this badge. In addition, they need not be complete in the sense
described above. They simply need to be relevant to the study and add value
beyond the text in the article. Such artifacts could be something as simple
as the data from which the figures are drawn, or as complex as a complete
software system under study.

validation.

<p>
<i>Unfortunately, current criteria for awarding this badge are vague. 
We work with <a href="http://cKnowledge.org/partners.html">the community</a> to develop <a href="http://cKnowledge.org">Collective Knowledge framework</a>
which can help authors share their artifacts and workflows as <a href="http://cKnowledge.org/shared-packages.html">reusable, portable and customizable components</a>
with a standard API. The idea is to automatically award this badge when authors use portable and customizable workflow frameworks
(see <a href="https://portalparts.acm.org/3230000/3229762/fm/frontmatter.pdf">ACM ReQuEST</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck-scc18/wiki">SC SCC</a> for more details).

     </td>
     <td valign="top">
The artifacts associated with the paper will receive an "Artifact Evaluated - Reusable" badge 
<i>only if</i> they are of a quality that significantly exceeds minimal functionality. 
That is, they have all the qualities of the Artifacts Evaluated - Functional level, 
but, in addition, they are very carefully documented and well-structured to the extent 
that reuse and repurposing is facilitated. In particular, norms and standards of the research
community for artifacts of this type are strictly adhered to.

       Note that variation of empirical and numerical results is tolerated.

       (for example to perform full training of a deep learning model),
       we now discuss a staged AE where we will first validate that
       artifacts are functional before camera ready paper, and then
       use a separate AE with full validation of all results based on 
       <a href="http://cKnowledge.org/request">ACM ReQuEST tournament methodology</a>
       without strict deadlines. We plan to validate this approach
       at <a href="http://sysml.cc">SysML'19</a>.</i>
