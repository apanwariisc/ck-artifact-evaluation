<p>
Authors of accepted <a href="http://conf.researchr.org/home/ppopp-2018">PPoPP 2018</a> papers 
are invited to formally submit their supporting materials to the 
<a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$index$#ck_page_suffix#$">Artifact Evaluation process (AE)</a>. 
AE is run by a <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$committee$#ck_page_suffix#$">separate committee</a> 
whose task is to validate experimental workflows,
reproduce (at least some) experiments 
and <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$reviewing$#ck_page_suffix#$">assess</a> 
how the artifacts support the work described in the
papers. This submission is voluntary and will not
influence the final decision regarding the papers.

<p>
Papers that successfully go through the Artifact Evaluation 
process will receive 
<a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging">a set of ACM badges of approval</a> 
printed on the papers themselves and available as meta information 
in the ACM Digital Library. 
Authors of such papers will have an option
to include their Artifact Appendix to the final paper (up to 2 pages).
Authors are also encouraged (though not obliged) to make these
materials publicly available upon publication of the
proceedings, by including them as "source materials"
in the <a href="http://dl.acm.org">Digital Library</a>.

<p>
<i>If you have any questions, please check <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$faq$#ck_page_suffix#$">AE FAQs</a>
and do not hesitate to contact AE chair and the steering committee or post your question
to our <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/grp/home?gid=7433414">LinkedIn group</a>.
</i>

<h3>How to submit</h3>

Please prepare your artifacts for submission using the following <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$submission$#ck_page_suffix#$">guide</a>.
Then, register your submission at the <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aeppopp2018">PPoPP AE EasyChair website</a> - 
you will be asked to submit your paper title, author list, artifact abstract, pdf of your paper with an appendix describing how to access 
and validate your artifacts, and possible conflicts of interests with  
<a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$committee$#ck_page_suffix#$">AE members</a>. 

<p>
<i>Note that we collaborate with <a href="http://acm.org">ACM</a> 
to unify packing and sharing of artifacts as reusable and customizable components
using <a href="http://cKnowledge.org">Collective Knowledge framework</a>
(see <a href="https://dl.acm.org/docs/reproducibility.cfm">ACM announcement</a>).
You are not obliged to use CK since it may only influence "Artifacts Evaluated - Reusable" badge 
but not the overall evaluation. However if you are interested to try it, 
<a href="http://cTuning.org">cTuning foundation</a> 
offers free help to convert your workflows
to the CK format while reusing already existing artifacts 
(for example, see <a href="http://cKnowledge.org/ai-artifacts">reusable AI artifacts</a>)
either before or soon after your submission. 
Feel free to contact <a href="mailto:Grigori.Fursin@cTuning.org">Grigori Fursin</a> 
as soon as possible for more details. The highest ranked artifacts shared in the CK format
will receive a 300$ Amazon gift card from <a href="http://dividiti.com">dividiti</a>.
For example, check out distinguished artifact from the join CGO/PPoPP'17 AE
which was shared using CK framework: <a href="https://github.com/SamAinsworth/reproduce-cgo2017-paper">GitHub</a>,
<a href="http://localhost/work-artifact-evaluation/web.php?page=resources/paper-with-distinguished-ck-artifact-and-ae-appendix-cgo2017.pdf">PDF with appendix</a>.
</i>

<h3>Reviewing process</h3>

Your artifacts will be reviewed according to the following <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$reviewing$#ck_page_suffix#$">guidelines</a>.
Artifacts receiving "met expectations" or above score will pass evaluation and will receive
a stamp of approval. The highest ranked artifacts will receive prizes.

<p>
<i>
If you have questions, comments and suggestions on how
to improve artifact submission, reviewing, customization
and reuse, please do not hesitate to get in touch with 
AE chairs and/or steering committee!
