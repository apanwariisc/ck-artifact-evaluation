<p>
Reproducing experimental results from computer systems' papers 
and building upon them is becoming extremely challenging and time consuming. 
Major issues include ever changing and possibly proprietary software 
and hardware, lack of common tools and interfaces, stochastic
behavior of computer systems, lack of common experimental methodology,
and lack of universally accepted mechanisms for knowledge exchange.
