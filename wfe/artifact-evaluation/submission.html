<!-- We currently use <a href="http://www.artifact-eval.org/guidelines.html">the following guidelines</a> 
for packaging artifact submissions. However, we are preparing a revised version that should be available
around mid-October 2015! 
-->
 
<p>
This guide (<b>V20151015</b>) should help you describe, pack 
and submit your artifacts for a review.


It gradually evolves based on <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$prior_ae$#ck_page_suffix#$">our past Artifact Evaluations</a>
and your feedback (see this <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/GrigoriFursin/presentation-fursin-aecgoppopp2015">presentation</a>
with an outcome of the past PPoPP/CGO'15 AE).


It should also help you prepare your artifacts 
for a possible public release, if you plan to do so
(for example as an auxiliary material in a Digital
Library or on your personal web page).


<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2>What to expect</h2>

You will need to prepare a small and relatively informal guide for reviewers 
using our <a href="$#ck_url_template_pull#$templates/ae_template_20151015.tex">AE LaTeX template</a> 
to explain what are your artifacts, how to access and 
use them, and what is the expected result (<i>we currently discuss with the 
conference chairs and ACM to let you keep this document as appendix in your 
paper if your artifact passes evaluation</i>).

At least two reviewers (or the whole community if you submit 
for <a href="http://adapt-workshop.org">ADAPT</a>) will follow your guide to replicate 
your results (for example, exact output match) or reproduce them 
(for example, slightly varying performance numbers or scalability
on a different machine), and will then send you a report with the 
following overall assessment of your artifact based 
on our <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$reviewing$#ck_page_suffix#$">reviewing guidelines</a>:

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>significantly exceeded expectations</b>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>exceeded expectations</b>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>met expectations</b>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>fell below expectations</b>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>significantly fell below expectations</b>
 </li>
</ul>

where <b>"met expectations" score or above</b> means that your artifact 
successfully passed evaluation and will receive a stamp of approval
(added to the paper itself):

<center>
<img src="$#ck_url_template_pull#$resources/ae_logo.png">
</center>

The highest ranked artifact will also receive a <i>"distinguished artifact" 
award</i>  (see <a href="http://cTuning.org/event/ae-ppopp2015">PPoPP'15</a> 
and <a href="http://cTuning.org/event/ae-cgo2015">CGO'15</a> AE prizes)
announced at the joint CGO-PPoPP'16 AE discussion session.

This section is also used as a discussion forum with the community
about how to improve AE.

<p>
Since our eventual goal is not to name and shame
problematic artifacts, but to promote artifact
validation and sharing, you will be able to address
raised issues during the rebuttal.

Furthermore, we allow light communication between reviewers and authors 
whenever there are installation/usage problems.

In such cases, AE chairs will serve as a proxy to avoid 
revealing reviewers' identity (unless you submit artifacts 
along with your publication for an <a href="http://adapt-workshop.org">ADAPT 
workshop with a public Reddit-based evaluation</a>).

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2>Preparing artifacts for submission</h2>

To minimize your effort, we prepared a <a href="$#ck_url_template_pull#$templates/ae_template.tex">LaTeX template</a> 
which you can fill in, append to the end of your paper, and submit the final PDF for the artifact review.

Each template subsection is described below.

If you encounter problems or have any questions, do not hesitate to 
contact <a href="mailto:childers@cs.pitt.edu;Grigori.Fursin@cTuning.org">AE chairs</a> privately
or use our public <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/grp/home?gid=7433414">LinkedIn group</a> 
and this <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/collective-knowledge">mailing list</a>.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Abstract}

{\em Obligatory}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Description}
\subsubsection{How delivered}

package (VM, Docker, tar/zip/gzip, OCCAM, CK, ...)
 or
private machine with pre-installed software 
 (when using)

public website
private website

everything included or has to be rebuild

Approximate HDD size required

\subsubsection{Hardware dependencies}

specific hardware
 (vendor, CPU/GPU/FPGA, number of processors/cores, 
  interconnect, memory, counters


\subsubsection{Software dependencies}

specific OS (patched Linux)
libraries
compilers
tools

If third-party/proprietary software has to be used, 
we strongly suggest to describe where to get and how to install
(we are arranging some AE licenses for commonly used tools)

\subsubsection{Datasets}

included, open source, need to download, proprietary/can provide alternative, some smaller subset


interactive report

\subsubsection{Expected output}

Replication or reproducibility:
Just tool output, performance numbers, scalability, etc

\subsection{Evaluation}

How to get expected output, report unexpected behavior or bugs

\subsection{Notes}

If you know where possible unexpected behavior or problems 
(that you maybe even plan to solve in the future)

<h2>Examples of accepted artifacts</h2>




<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2>Methodology archive</h2>

To help readers understand which submission/reviewing methodology was used in papers 
with evaluated artifacts we keep track of all past versions:
<ul>
 <li><b>V20151015 (PPoPP'16/CGO'16/ADAPT'16)</b>: 
  <a href="$#ck_url_template_pull#$templates/ae-20151015.tex">LaTeX template</a>,
  <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$submission-20151015$#ck_page_suffix#$">submission guide</a>,
  <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$reviewing-20151015$#ck_page_suffix#$">reviewing guide</a>
</ul>

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2>Artifact sharing</h2>

Though you are not obliged to publicly release your artifacts 
(in fact, it is sometimes impossible due to various limitations), 
we strongly encourage you to share them with the community
(even if they are not open-source).

You can release them as an auxilary material in Digital Libraries,
your institutional repository, various open services for code
and data sharing.

Furthermore, many of the encountered problems during AE 
motivated us to start developing a supporting open-source technology 
that can help improve artifact sharing, validation and reuse:
<ul>
 <li>
  <b><a href="http://www.occamportal.org">OCCAM Framework</a></b> - enabling open curation for computer architecture modeling.
 </li>
 <li>
  <b><a href="http://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki">Collective Knowledge Framework (CK)</a></b> - 
  converting artifacts into reusable components and experimental workflows with Python-based wrappers and unified JSON API
  shared via <a href="http://github.com/ctuning/ck">GitHub</a> (see example of PLDI'15
  CLSmith artifact converted into CK); enabling interactive and reproducible articles
  (see example of an <a href="http://cknowledge.org/repo/web.php?wcid=report:b0779e2a64c22907">interactive report</a> 
  for CK-powered universal and multi-objective OpenCL autotuning). 
 </li>
</ul>
