Authors of accepted <a href="http://pactconf.org">PACT 2018</a> papers 
are invited to formally submit their supporting materials for 
<a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$submission$#ck_page_suffix#$">Artifact Evaluation</a>. 
Submission is voluntary.
The Artifact Evaluation process is run by a separate committee whose task is to
<a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$reviewing$#ck_page_suffix#$">assess</a> 
if artifacts supporting the work described in the papers are available and functional, 
and (some of) experimental results are reproducible. 

<p>
<i>If you have any questions, please check <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$faq$#ck_page_suffix#$">AE FAQs</a>
and do not hesitate to contact <a href="mailto:tcarlson@comp.nus.edu.sg;las@inesc-id.pt">AE chairs</a>!
</i>

<h3>How to submit</h3>

You should prepare your artifacts for submission using the following
<a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$submission$#ck_page_suffix#$">guidelines</a>. 
Then, register your submission at the <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pact18artifactevalua">EasyChair</a> - 
you will be asked to submit your paper title, author list, artifact abstract with a special checklist 
(to help select appropriate evaluators), PDF of your paper with an artifact appendix describing how 
to access and validate your artifacts, and describe possible conflicts of interests.
<b>Please, do not forget to provide a list of hardware, software, benchmark and data set dependencies in your artifact abstract - this is essential to find appropriate evaluators!</b>

<h3>Reviewing process</h3>

Your artifacts will be reviewed according to the following 
<a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$reviewing$#ck_page_suffix#$">guidelines</a>.
The papers that successfully go through AE will receive 
<a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging">a set of ACM badges of approval</a> 
printed on the papers themselves (will be added by ACM to camera-ready papers) and available as meta information 
in the ACM Digital Library (it is now possible to search for papers with specific badges in ACM DL).
Authors of such papers will have an option
to include Artifact Appendix to the final paper (up to 2 pages).
Authors are also encouraged (though not obliged)
to make their artifacts publicly available upon publication
of the proceedings.


<h3>Feedback</h3>

We consider Artifact Evaluation as a continuous learning curve - 
our eventual goal is to develop a common methodology for experiment sharing
and evaluation in computer system's research. 

Therefore, if you have questions, comments and suggestions 
on how to improve artifact submission, reviewing, customization
and reuse, please do not hesitate to get in touch with the 
<a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$steering$#ck_page_suffix#$#steering">AE steering committee</a>!
