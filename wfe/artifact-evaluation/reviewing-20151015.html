<!-- We currently use <a href="http://www.artifact-eval.org/review-process.html">the following guidelines</a> 
for reviewing artifacts. However, we are preparing a revised version that should be available
around mid-October 2015! 
-->

<p>
This document provides guidelines to review artifacts. 
It gradually evolves based on <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$prior_ae$#ck_page_suffix#$">our past Artifact Evaluations</a>
and your feedback (see this <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/GrigoriFursin/presentation-fursin-aecgoppopp2015">presentation</a>
with an outcome of the AE for PPoPP'15 and CGO'15</a>).
