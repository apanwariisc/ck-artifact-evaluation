SysML promotes reproducibility of experimental results 
and encourages code and data sharing to help the community quickly validate and compare alternative approaches.
Authors of accepted SysML'19 papers are invited to formally 
describe supporting material (code, data, models, workflows, results) 
using the <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$/templates/ae-20190108.tex">standard Artifact Appendix template</a>
and submit it to the <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$index$#ck_page_suffix#$">Artifact Evaluation process (AE)</a>.
Note that this submission is <b>voluntary</b>, will <b>not influence</b> the final decision regarding the papers,
and promotes artifact sharing and reproducible research! For example, ACM Digital Library
already allows one to find papers with available artifacts and reproducible results!

<p>
You need to prepare your artifacts and appendix using the following 
<a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$submission$#ck_page_suffix#$">guidelines</a>.
You can then submit your paper with artifact appendix via 
dedicated <a href="https://sysml19ae.hotcrp.com">SysML AE website</a> before January 18, 2019. 
Your submission will be then reviewed according to the 
following <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$reviewing$#ck_page_suffix#$">guidelines</a>.

<b>Please, do not forget to provide a list of hardware, software, benchmark and data set dependencies 
in your artifact abstract - this is essential to find appropriate evaluators!</b>


<p>AE is run by a separate committee whose task is to <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$reviewing$#ck_page_suffix#$">assess</a> 
how submitted artifacts support the work described in accepted papers
based on the standard <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging">ACM Artifact Review and Badging policy</a>.

<b>Since it may be very time consuming to perform full validation of AI/ML experiments
while requiring expensive computational resources, we decided to only validate if submitted artifacts 
are "available" and "functional" at SysML'19. However, you still need to provide 
a small sample data set to test the functionality of your artifact.</b>

Thus, depending on evaluation results, camera-ready papers will include the artifact appendix and will receive at most two ACM stamps of approval printed on their first page:
 <p>
 <center>
  <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging"><img src="$#ck_url_template_pull#$resources/acm-ae-badge-available.png" width="108"></a>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging"><img src="$#ck_url_template_pull#$resources/acm-ae-badge-functional.png" width="100"></a>
 </center>

At the end of the process we will inform you about how to add badges 
to your camera-ready paper.

<i>If you would like to use the <a href="http://cKnowledge.org">Collective Knowledge framework</a> (not obligatory)
to automate your workflow and think you might need some assistance, please <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/collective-knowledge">contact us</a> in advance!
We are developing CK to help authors reduce their time and effort
when preparing AI/ML/SW/HW workflows for artifact evaluation by reusing 
<a href="http://cKnowledge.org/shared-packages.html">data sets, models and frameworks</a>
already shared by the community in a common format.
This, in turn, should enable evaluators to quickly validate results 
in an automated and portable way.
