<h3>Should my software artifacts be open-source?</h3>

No, it is not strictly necessary and you can 
provide your software artifact as a binary.
However, in case of problems, reviewers will not be 
able to fix it and will likely give you a negative score.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Is Artifact evaluation blind or double-blind?</h3>

AE is a single-blind process, i.e. authors' names are known to the evaluators
(there is no need to hide them since papers are accepted),
but names of evaluators are not known to the authors.
AE chair is usually used as a proxy between the authors and the evaluators
in case of questions and problems.

<p>
In the future, we would like to move to a fully open, community-driven evaluation
which was successfully validated at <a href="http://adapt-workshop.org/motivation2016.html">ADAPT'16</a> -
your comments and ideas are welcome!

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>How to pack artifacts?</h3>

We do not have strict requirements at this stage. You can pack 
your artifacts simply in a tar ball, zip file, Virtual Machine or Docker image.
You can also share artifacts via public services such as GitHub or BitBucket.
Please see <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$submission$#ck_page_suffix#$">our submission guide</a> 
for more details.

<p>
However, from our <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/GrigoriFursin/presentation-fursin-aecgoppopp2015">past Artifact Evaluation</a>, 
the most challenging part is to automate and customize
experimental workflows. It is even worse, if you need
to validate experiments using latest software environment
and hardware (rather than quickly outdated VM and Docker
images). Currently, some ad-hoc scripts are used
to implement such workflows. They are difficult to change
and customize, particularly when an evaluator would like 
to try other compilers, libraries and data sets.

<p>
Therefore, we decided to develop <a href="http://github.com/ctuning/ck">Collective Knowledge Framework (CK)</a> - 
a small, portable and customizable framework to help researchers share their artifacts as reusable Python components 
with a unified JSON API. This approach should help researchers quickly prototype experimental workflows 
(such as multi-objective autotuning) from such components while automatically detecting and resolving
all required software or hardware dependencies. CK is also intended to reduce evaluators' burden
by unifying statistical analysis and predictive analytics (via scikit-learn, R, DNN), 
and enabling interactive reports. Please see examples of a <a href="http://cknowledge.org/repo">live repository</a>,
<a href="http://cknowledge.org/interactive-report">interactive article</a> 
and <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Getting_started_guide_clsmith">PLDI'15 CLSmith artifact shared in CK format</a>.
Feel free to contact us, if you would like to use it but need some help to convert your artifacts into CK format.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Is it possible to provide a remote access to a machine with pre-installed artifacts?</h3>

Only in exceptional cases, i.e. when rare hardware or proprietary software is required,
or VM image is too large, or when you are not authorized to move artifacts outside your organization.
In such case, you will need to send an access information 
to the AE chairs via private email or SMS. They will then pass
this information to the evaluators.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Can I share commercial benchmarks or software with evaluators?</h3>

Please check the license of your benchmarks, data sets and software. 
In case of any doubts, try to find a free alternative. Note, that we have 
a preliminary agreement with the EEMBC consortium to let authors 
share their EEMBC benchmarks with the evaluators for Artifact Evaluation purposes.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Should I make my artifacts customizable? How can I plug in benchmarks and datasets from others?</h3>

It is encouraged but not strictly necessary. Note, that we are developing
a supporting <a href="http://cknowledge.org">Collective Knowledge technology</a> 
to simply sharing of artifacts and experimental workflows as customizable 
and reusable components. Benchmarks, data sets, models, tools and scripts 
shared in the CK format can be automatically plugged in to the experimental workflow.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h3>Do I have to make my artifacts public if they pass evaluation?</h3>

You are not obliged to make your artifacts public (particularly in case of commercial artifacts).
Nevertheless, we strongly encourage you to make your artifacts publicly available upon publication 
of the proceedings (for example, by including them as "source materials"
in the Digital Library).
